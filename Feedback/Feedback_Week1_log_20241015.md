# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The project repository follows a logical structure with separate directories for `code`, `data`, `sandbox`, and `results`, which aligns well with standard practices. However, the absence of a `.gitignore` file could lead to unnecessary files being tracked. Including a `.gitignore` file is recommended to exclude temporary files and unwanted results from version control.

### README Files
The main `README.md` is very minimal. It would benefit from including more detailed instructions about the repository structure, dependencies, and how to run the scripts. Additionally, the missing README in the Week1 directory could explain the purpose and functionality of the scripts in more detail.

## Workflow
The overall workflow is appropriate, with a good separation of code, data, and results. However, the results directory contains some files, which ideally should not be included in version control unless they are necessary for others to replicate results. It would be better to generate these outputs dynamically by running the scripts.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **Variables.sh:**
   - The script demonstrates the use of variables well, but there is an error with the use of `expr` for arithmetic. It is recommended to replace it with:
     ```bash
     MY_SUM=$(($a + $b))
     ```
   - Overall, the script handles user input effectively, but it would benefit from additional checks to handle invalid input.

2. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - The script processes `.fasta` files as expected, including counting lines and computing the AT/GC ratio. Consider adding more detailed comments, especially for complex commands like `gsub` in `awk`. This will improve readability for others who may not be familiar with these commands.

3. **CountLines.sh:**
   - The script checks for valid input and counts the number of lines in a file. It would be helpful to provide more specific error messages, and the script could benefit from using `$()` for command substitution instead of backticks for better readability:
     ```bash
     NumLines=$(wc -l < "$1")
     ```

4. **TabToCSV.sh:**
   - This script effectively converts tab-delimited files to CSV. It includes useful checks to validate input, but more detailed error messages could enhance user experience. Also, the output file path is correctly handled using `basename`, which is a good practice.

5. **CsvToSpace.sh:**
   - The script converts CSV files to space-separated values and includes input validation and error handling. It correctly handles paths using `basename`, but more specific error messages would be helpful. Additionally, it's good that the script automatically creates the results directory if it doesn't exist.

6. **Tiff2PNG.sh:**
   - This script converts `.tif` files to `.png` format but throws an error when no `.tif` files are found. It would be beneficial to add a check to ensure `.tif` files are present before attempting conversion. Also, verifying if `ImageMagick` is installed before running the `convert` command would make the script more robust.

7. **MyExampleScript.sh:**
   - The script prints a simple greeting using the `$USER` environment variable. It runs as expected and requires no major changes.

8. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - The script efficiently concatenates two input files into a third output file. It includes good input validation, but adding a check to ensure the output file does not already exist would prevent overwriting files unintentionally.

9. **Boilerplate.sh:**
   - The boilerplate script is a simple template for shell scripts. It functions correctly and can be used as a base for more complex scripts.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across most scripts, error handling is generally solid, but it could be enhanced by providing more descriptive error messages and checking for file existence before overwriting output files.
- **Command Substitution:** Replace backticks (`) with `$(command)` for better readability and compatibility.
- **Comments:** Adding more comments, especially in more complex scripts like `UnixPrac1.txt`, would improve maintainability and make the code easier for others to understand.
- **File Overwriting Prevention:** In scripts like `ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh`, add checks to prevent accidental overwriting of output files.

## Overall Feedback
The project structure is organized well, and the scripts are functional. With some minor improvements to error handling, comments, and file existence checks, the project would be even more robust and user-friendly. Overall, the work demonstrates a solid understanding of scripting and workflow organization.
