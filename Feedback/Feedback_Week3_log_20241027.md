# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Code Structure

## General Project Structure and Workflow

- **Directory Organization**: The project is well-structured, with weekly folders (`week1`, `week2`, `week3`) and subdirectories (`code`, `data`, `results`). This logical organization simplifies navigation and maintains clarity on weekly assignments.
- **README Files**: The README file in the `week3` directory provides a helpful overview of project contents, key sections, and dependencies. Expanding on specific usage instructions, especially for key scripts like `DataWrang.R`, `Girko.R`, and `MyBars.R`, would further improve usability.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Expand Documentation**: In addition to the project descriptions, include sample input/output and usage instructions for primary scripts, which can improve clarity for new users.
2. **Error Management**: Ensure that all essential libraries (e.g., `ggplot2`, `reshape2`) are installed or documented in a setup script to avoid dependency errors.

## Code Structure and Syntax Feedback

### R Scripts in `week3/code`

1. **break.R**: Demonstrates loop controls effectively. Adding inline comments to explain the break condition (e.g., `i == 10`) would improve clarity.
2. **sample.R**: Compares various looping and vectorization methods for sampling. Adding a summary of performance differences directly in the comments would illustrate the advantages of preallocation.
3. **Vectorize1.R**: Compares loop and vectorized summation effectively. Adding comments that clarify each performance measurement would make it more informative.
4. **R_conditionals.R**: Well-structured with functions for numeric properties. Minor additions to function descriptions and edge case checks (e.g., `NA` values) could enhance robustness.
5. **apply1.R**: Demonstrates row and column operations with `apply()`. Adding comments on the purpose of each operation would improve understanding.
6. **basic_io.R**: Manages data I/O well, though redundant writes (e.g., appending columns repeatedly) could be streamlined for efficiency.
7. **Girko.R**: Script plots eigenvalues but raises an error due to `ggplot2`. Adding `ggplot2` as a required library or confirming its installation would prevent runtime issues.
8. **boilerplate.R**: Basic function template with useful output types. Adding more detailed comments explaining the arguments and return values would enhance understanding.
9. **apply2.R**: Uses `apply()` for matrix manipulation effectively. Inline comments explaining the function of conditions, such as `sum(v) > 0`, would improve readability.
10. **DataWrang.R**: Wrangles biological data using `reshape2`. Adding comments for each step of data transformation and handling would improve readability and make debugging easier.
11. **try.R**: Contains effective error handling but could benefit from `tryCatch()` for more detailed control and readability.
12. **control_flow.R**: Demonstrates various control flow structures well. Adding headers summarizing each loop structure (e.g., `for` vs `while`) would enhance comprehension.
13. **Ricker.R**: Simple and effective simulation model. Adding comments explaining parameters (e.g., `r`, `K`) would clarify the function.
14. **MyBars.R**: Script for plotting bar ranges but shows errors due to missing `ggplot2`. Documenting or installing this package would prevent runtime errors.
15. **TreeHeight.R**: Calculates tree heights with clear outputs. Including a sample calculation in the comments would demonstrate expected output.
16. **plotLin.R**: Linear regression plot with `ggplot2` but raises an error due to missing dependency. As with `MyBars.R`, ensuring `ggplot2` is installed would resolve this.
17. **next.R**: Simple loop with `next` function. Inline comments explaining the purpose of `next` here (skipping even numbers) would clarify usage.
18. **browse.R**: Debugging with `browser()` in a loop. Commenting out `browser()` in production-ready scripts or isolating it in a `sandbox` directory would streamline code.
19. **preallocate.R**: Effectively demonstrates preallocation benefits. Adding summary comments for timing comparisons would enhance learning.

### General Code Suggestions

- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent indentation, especially in scripts like `break.R`, to maintain readability.
- **Error Handling**: Enhancing error handling (e.g., `tryCatch()` for advanced control in `try.R`) across scripts will make them more robust for varied inputs.
- **Comments**: Adding explanatory comments to complex scripts like `DataWrang.R` and `Girko.R` will make them easier to understand.
