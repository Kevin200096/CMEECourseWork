Q 14 :    2.5 / 3    comments: this needed to spell out more completely the reason why the system leads to monodominance - explain explicitly that no speciation means no new species and explain why richness can't go to zero.
Q 15 :    3 / 3
Q 16 :    1 / 1
Q 17 :    1 / 1
Q 18 :    3.5 / 4    comments: ideally would have explained more why we get such a balance, higher richness means more extinction, dynamic equilibrium etc.
Q 19 :    3 / 3
Q 20 :    3 / 3
Q 21 :    2 / 2
Q 22 :    3.5 / 4    comments: needed to answer the question of why the initial conditions do not matter otherwise excellent
Q 23 :    6 / 6
Q 24 :    6 / 6
Q 25 :    9.5 / 10    comments: the .e files were supposed to be handed in even if empty

Marks for text quality :  5 /8
Comments...
In question 1 needed more detail as to why this happens and would be better to spell out things like population rather than just saying 'pop'
In question 2 excellent
In question 5 good but would have benefitted from being explained more and written as prose rather than with + symbol and missing words
In question 6 very good, but could have explained a bit more clearly and with more detail
In question 14 well written but doesn't go deep enough to show full understanding by explaining why
In question 18 well written but could have explained more the reasons
In question 22 well written but brief and leaves out details / reasoning
 
Marks for graphics quality :  8.9 /10
Comments...
In question 1 Very good but would be nice to move the legend so it doesn't overlap the data
In question 2 excellent, I'm being fussy to say this but would be better without a box around the legend - a very minor point though
In question 5 excellent
In question 6 excellent, but would be nice to get rid of the box around the legend
In question 14 exemplary
In question 18 excellent, if I was being picky I'd say remove the box from the legend
In question 22 very good, but needed labels on the octaves to get full marks
In question 26 very good but ideally would label the octaves as well
 
Marks for code quality :  7.5 /8
Comments...
excellent, clear and well commented, some comments not in English
 
Marks for challenge questions :  13 /14
Comments...
challenge question A, excellent, though if I'm being picky I would say axes are better than those grids in the final graph - would make it look more like a paper
challenge question B, a higher resolution output would have been nice
challenge question C, excellent
challenge question D, good though the legend obscures part of the data in the chart and I'm not convinced about the duration of the time series, the smaller communities should be the ones that run for longer if this was all fully correct'
challenge question E, excellent, though the graph could have been improved with better octave labels (1, 2-3, 4-7 and so on) and again I prefer axes to grids.
