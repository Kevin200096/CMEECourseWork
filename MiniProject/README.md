# Miniproject Summary

- **Summary**: This repository contains a mini-project assessing different models (Logistic, Gompertz, and polynomial) for bacterial growth data.
- **Author**: Kevin Zhao
- **Contact**: zhetao.zhao24@imperial.ac.uk
- **Date**: March 2025
- **R Environment**: Created in R version 4.1.1 with the following packages:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `minpack.lm`
  - `stringr`
  - `patchwork`
  - `xtable`

## Code

Within the `code` directory, you will find:

- **`Mini_data_prep.R`**: Cleans and preprocesses the raw dataset `LogisticGrowthData.csv` by removing invalid entries (e.g., negative population values) and preparing the data for model fitting.

- **`Mini_model_fit.R`**: Fits various growth models (Logistic, Gompertz, Quadratic, Cubic) to the cleaned dataset. It compares model performance via AICc, BIC, and \(R^2\) metrics. Results are saved to `model_results.csv`, and a combined PDF of fitted curves is created in the `results` folder.

- **`Mini_plots.R`**: Generates example plots demonstrating different “best-fit” models. Outputs an illustrative figure (`example_bestfits.png`) saved to the `results` folder.

- **`Mini_Report.tex`**: A LaTeX report discussing the methodology, results, and conclusions derived from the analysis. It references figures and tables generated by the above R scripts, along with a bibliography for references.

- **`run_MiniProject.sh`**: Primary bash script to orchestrate:
  1. Data preparation (`Mini_data_prep.R`)
  2. Model fitting (`Mini_model_fit.R`)
  3. Plot generation (`Mini_plots.R`)
  4. LaTeX compilation of `Mini_Report.tex` (including references)
  
  Running `./run_MiniProject.sh` from the project root should generate all outputs.

- **`Mini_references`**: The reference file for `Mini_Report.tex`.

## Data

Within the `data` directory:

- **`LogisticGrowthData.csv`**: Primary bacterial growth dataset used for fitting.  
- **`LogisticGrowthMetaData.csv`**: 
---

## Results

Within the `results` directory:

- **`fitted_models.pdf`**: Plots of all fitted curves for each subset of data (created by `Mini_model_fit.R`).
- **`model_results.csv`**: Summary of model performance statistics (AICc, BIC, \(R^2\), etc.).
- **`model_results.tex`**: A LaTeX-formatted table of the above summary.
- **`example_bestfits.png`**: Illustration of representative curves with different “best-fit” models (from `Mini_plots.R`).

**Usage**  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Navigate to the project root in a terminal.  
3. Make `run_MiniProject.sh` executable with `chmod +x run_MiniProject.sh`.  
4. Run `./run_MiniProject.sh`.  
5. Check the `results` folder for generated outputs and the compiled PDF report.
