## 🤖 FinalProject
**LD-based Ne inference with msprime simulations + Machine Learning**  

This project uses **msprime simulations** and **linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay summaries** (Burrows’ r² binned on the c-scale) to infer effective population size (Ne).  

Scenarios:
- 🔢 **Strategy-1 (Grid):** 10 fixed Ne values  
- 📈 **Strategy-2 (Uniform):** continuous Ne from Uniform(5e2, 5e5)  
- ⏳ **Three-epoch Ne:** Ne1 (recent), Ne2 (intermediate), Ne3 (ancient)  

Highlights:
- 📂 Pre-generated datasets (`dataset_grid.csv`, `dataset_uniform.csv`, `dataset_threeepoch.csv`)  
- 🤖 Ready-to-run training scripts (RF/XGBoost)  
- 📊 Metrics, plots, and SHAP interpretability  
- 🔁 Reproducible pipelines
