CMEE coursework week 1 contents can be found in this repository. First submission
This coursework demonstrates the use of Unix shell scripting for biological data processing. The exercises cover a range of tasks, including file manipulation, sequence analysis, and command-line utilities. The focus is on efficiently processing data files such as .fasta and .csv.

Languages
Shell Scripting: All scripts are written in Unix shell scripts.
Dependencies
To run these scripts, a Unix-like operating system is required with the following installed:
Bash: Version 4 or higher.
Core Unix utilities: Such as awk, grep, sed, cut, tr, and wc.

Description of Code Files
The code/ folder contains the following shell scripts:
MyExampleScript.sh
Demonstrates basic Unix commands.
csvtospace.sh
Converts CSV files to space-separated files.
boilerplate.sh
A template script with standard comments and metadata.
variables.sh
Demonstrates the usage of shell variables.
tabtocsv.sh
Converts tab-separated files to CSV format.
tiff2png.sh
Converts TIFF images to PNG format.
UnixPrac1.sh
Processes .fasta files to perform the following tasks:
Count lines in all .fasta files.
Extract sequence data starting from the second line.
Calculate total sequence length.
Count specific DNA motifs (e.g., "ATGC").
Compute the AT/GC ratio.
CountLines.sh
Counts the number of lines in a specified file.
ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh
Concatenates two specified files.
The code files contains both "UNIX and Linux" and "Shell scripting" Practicals included codes
1. UNIX and Linux
FASTA exercise:
Count how many lines there are in each file
Print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome
Count the sequence length of this genome
Count the matches of a particular sequence, “ATGC” in the genome of E. coli (hint: Start by removing the first line and removing newline characters)
Compute the AT/GC ratio. That is, the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio (as a single number). This is a summary measure of base composition of double-stranded DNA. DNA from different organisms and lineages has different ratios of the A-to-T and G-to-C base pairs (google “Chargaff’s rule”). For example, DNA from organisms that live in hot springs have a higher GC content, the GC base pair is more thermally stable.
In order to achieve the above 5 goals, the solutions included in the UnixPrac1.txt with further detail instrction in commend. The UnixPrac1.txt is the only file for UNIX and Linux project which saved in code documents.
2. Shell scripting
Improving scripts:
The goal of this exercise is to make each such script robust so that it gives feedback to the user and exits if the right inputs are not provided.
ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh, tabtocsv.sh and CountLines.sh have been imfroved for this task.
A new shell script:
I have write a csvtospace.sh shell script that takes a comma separated values and converts it to a space separated values file. 
Other script:
Rest of the document have been required to save in code documents via https://themulquabio.github.io/TMQB/notebooks/02-ShellScripting.html.

Data
The data/ folder contains the following files:
E.coli.fasta
E. coli genome sequence in FASTA format.
407228326.fasta and 407228412.fasta
Sample biological sequence data in FASTA format.
1800.csv, 1801.csv, 1802.csv, 1803.csv
CSV files containing temperature data.

Feedback-Based Improvements
All documents has changed base on feedback from week 1

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the week1 directory:
cd week1
Ensure the required data files are present in the data/ folder.
Run any script with the following command:
bash code/<script_name>.sh
