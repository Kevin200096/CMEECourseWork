Project structure and Usage of Practica:
-code
1. Loops and List Comprehensions
> lc1.py # lc1.py demonstrates the use of list comprehensions to generate new lists by extracting and transforming data, such as Latin names, common names, and body mass, and compares this with the traditional for loop method.
> lc2.py # lc2.py further explores list comprehensions for filtering data based on conditions, such as selecting months with rainfall above 100mm, and contrasts the list comprehension approach with regular loops for clarity and efficiency.
> dictionary.py # dictionary.py shows how to use a dictionary to categorize and store genus names and their associated species, utilizing sets to avoid duplicates and leveraging list comprehensions to efficiently generate the dictionary.
> tuple.py # tuple.py deals with iterating over a list of tuples and formatting the output of Latin names, common names, and body mass, highlighting how to extract and display information from immutable data structures.

2. Writing a Program with Control flows
> cfexercises1.py # contains a set of basic functions demonstrating control flow in Python, such as calculating square roots, factorials, and sorting numbers. Each function is refactored to take user inputs and is tested with sample arguments to showcase how control flows like loops and conditionals are applied to solve common computational problems.

3. Align DNA sequences
> align_seqs.py # align_seqs.py implements a simple DNA sequence alignment algorithm that aligns two DNA sequences to maximize the number of matching bases. It iterates over all possible starting points of the shorter sequence against the longer one, calculates the alignment score, and outputs the alignment with the highest score. The code is enhanced to take sequences from a file and save the best alignment and score to an output file.

4. Missing oaks problem
> oaks_debugme.py # oaks_debugme.py processes a CSV file to identify oak tree species by checking if the genus is "Quercus". It uses a function is_an_oak to perform this check, originally with a bug that incorrectly identifies some species. The bug is fixed using fuzzy matching to account for typos in the genus name. The code also includes doctests to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid and invalid oak species, and writes the filtered results to a new CSV file.

-data
> sequences.csv # sequences.csv is a data file containing two DNA sequences, typically used as input for the align_seqs.py script. The sequences are aligned to find the best match by comparing them base by base, and the file serves as the source for the sequence alignment task, with the sequences being processed and analyzed for similarity in the alignment process.
> TestOaksData.csv # TestOaksData.csv is a CSV file containing a list of plant species with their genus and species names. It is used as input for the oaks_debugme.py script, where the script processes the data to identify and filter out oak species (genus "Quercus"). The file helps test the functionality of the script by providing both oak and non-oak species for comparison and filtering.

-results
> best_alignment.txt # best_alignment.txt is an output file generated by the align_seqs.py script. It contains the best alignment between two DNA sequences from sequences.csv, along with the corresponding alignment score. The file records the optimal alignment that maximizes the number of matching bases and is used to save and review the results of the sequence alignment process.
