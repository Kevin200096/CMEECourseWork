CMEE coursework week 3 contents can be found in this repository.
Week 3 contains the following sections:
> Biological Computing in R
> Data Management and Visualization

Week 3 uses the following languages:
> R

Week 3 have the following dependencies:
> tidyverse # a collection of R packages for data science, covering data import, cleaning, transformation, and visualization. It includes core packages like dplyr (data manipulation), ggplot2 (data visualization), and tidyr (data tidying), making it ideal for efficiently handling data analysis tasks. 
> reshape2 # used for reshaping data, especially useful for converting between wide and long formats. Key functions include melt() (wide to long) and dcast() (long to wide), helping prepare data into desired formats before analysis or visualization.
> ggplot2 (included in tidyverse) # a powerful R data visualization package based on the "grammar of graphics" concept, supporting layered creation of complex graphs. It allows for highly customizable graphics, making it suitable for creating high-quality, publication-level data visualizations.

Project Brief:
-Biological Computing in R
1. The study of class scripts of "Biological Computing in R" provides a foundation for data wrangling, processing, control structures, and common functions in R, especially for biological data. Key files introduce R basics like input/output handling (basic_io.R), conditionals (R_conditionals.R), flow control with break and next statements, script structure (boilerplate.R), vectorization (Vectorize1.R), efficient preallocation (preallocate.R), data manipulation functions (apply1.R, apply2.R), sampling (sample.R), and simulation models (e.g., Ricker.R). Additionally, error handling and debugging techniques are demonstrated in try.R and browse.R.

-Data Management and Visualization
2. The Data Management and Visualization section provides methods for handling biological data, including wrangling, reformatting, and visualizing with R. The files:
DataWrang.R - Processes raw data for analysis, including reshaping and metadata handling.
Girko.R - Demonstrates Girko's circular law using plots.
MyBars.R - Creates bar plots with R's plotting tools.
plotLin.R - Plots linear data for visualizing trends.
