CMEE Coursework Week 3 3rd and Final submission

This repository contains the coursework for Week 3 of the CMEE program. It focuses on two key areas: Biological Computing in R and Data Management and Visualization. The exercises emphasize R programming skills, including data wrangling, control structures, visualization, and statistical analysis.

Contents
Week 3 Sections:
Biological Computing in R
Data Management and Visualization
Programming Language:
R

Dependencies
The following R packages are required:
tidyverse: A collection of R packages for data import, manipulation, and visualization. Includes ggplot2 (for plotting) and dplyr (for data manipulation).
reshape2: For reshaping data (converting between wide and long formats). Used in earlier exercises before switching to tidyr.
maps: For geographical visualizations, used in mapping exercises.
Installation:
To install the required R packages, use the following commands:
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tidyverse")
if (!requireNamespace("reshape2", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("reshape2")
if (!requireNamespace("maps", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("maps")

Code Directory
The following files can be found in the code folder:
Biological Computing in R
Control Structures:
control_flow.R: Demonstrates the use of control structures in R, such as if, for, and while loops.
break.R: Explores breaking out of loops.
next.R: Illustrates skipping iterations in a loop.
Function Writing:
boilerplate.R: Provides a basic structure for writing R scripts.
R_conditionals.R: Uses functions to check numbers (even/odd, prime, power of two).
Vectorization and Performance:
Vectorize1.R: Compares loop-based and vectorized implementations.
preallocate.R: Highlights the performance benefits of preallocating vectors.
sample.R: Investigates sampling and computational efficiency.
Simulation Models:
Ricker.R: Implements and visualizes the Ricker population model.
try.R: Demonstrates error handling in R scripts.
browse.R: Explores debugging with browser() in R.
TreeHeight.R: Calculates tree heights from angle and distance measurements.

Data Management and Visualization
Data Wrangling:
DataWrang.R: Processes and reshapes biological data using reshape2.
DataWrangTidy.R: A modernized version of DataWrang.R using tidyverse.
Visualization:
Girko.R: Visualizes Girko's circular law with eigenvalues.
MyBars.R: Creates bar plots with error ranges.
plotLin.R: Plots linear regression with color gradients.
Statistical Analysis and Visualization:
PP_Dists.R: Analyzes predator-prey body mass distributions and generates subplots.
PP_Regress.R: Performs regression analysis and visualizes predator-prey relationships.
Mapping:
GPDD_Data.R: Maps Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) locations on a world map.

Data Directory
The following data files are used by the scripts:
trees.csv: Contains distance and angle data for calculating tree heights.
Results.txt: Input file for bar plot generation.
PoundHillData.csv and PoundHillMetaData.csv: Used for reshaping and metadata handling exercises.
EcolArchives-E089-51-D1.csv: Contains predator-prey interaction data for statistical analysis.
GPDDFiltered.RData: Latitude and longitude data for mapping exercises.

Results Directory
The results/ directory contains outputs generated by the scripts, such as:
PDF plots:
MyLinReg.pdf: Linear regression visualization.
Pred_Subplots.pdf, Prey_Subplots.pdf, SizeRatio_Subplots.pdf: Predator-prey body mass distributions.
PP_Regress.pdf: Regression analysis for predator-prey relationships.
GPDD_Map.pdf: World map with GPDD data locations.
CSV files:
PP_Results.csv: Statistical summaries of predator-prey mass distributions.
PP_Regress_Results.csv: Regression analysis results.

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project folder:
cd Week3/
Install the required R packages:
source("code/install_dependencies.R")
Run any script:
Rscript code/<script_name>.R

Feedback-Based Improvements
All documents has changed base on feedback from week 3.
Error Handling: Scripts now handle missing dependencies and provide user-friendly error messages.
Modularity: Functions are isolated for reusability and testing.
Documentation: Comprehensive comments and standardized headers are added to all scripts.

Extre Practicals completion
All the practicals that can be done have been completed, in order to increase contact and understanding
